<p ><font color="white" face="blackadder ITC" size="05">The Hawa Mahal also known as the ‘Palace of The Winds‘ is located in the heart of the Pink City of India- Jaipur. Built by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh in 1799, it’s a five-storey palace that belongs to the Kachhwaha Rajput dynasty. This ancient building is believed to be constructed in the form of Lord Krishna’s crown with pink and red sandstone. It was build for the royal women to have a view of daily life from the windows as they were not allowed to go out in the public. The pyramid shape and 953 windows or ‘Jharokhas’ of the Hawa Mahal are its main attraction that really magnetizes the visitors.</p>
